# systemc_model
My First systemc Model
Develop the model of a adder, It should have two inputs A & B of integer type, and one output OUT of integer type.
Whenever any of the input change, it should add both inputs and put the result on output port after 2 ns.

Test bench: Applies the values at input port at following times:
  0 ns: A= 0, B= 0
  5 ns: A= 5, B= 0
  8 ns: A= 5, B= 10
  15 ns: A= 7, B= 8

Whenever the value changes at the output port of adder, the testbench should print the value of this port and the simulation time
SOLUTION 
The code part is divided in 3 parts 
1. adder.h -> contains the basic logic for adder 
2. testbench.h -> contains the testbench
3. main.cpp 


Resuming Work – Request for New Task or Model Suggestion

Dear Fahmy,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have now resumed working after taking two weeks of rest due to a slipped disc. The prolonged sitting had become quite dangerous to my health, and the break was necessary for recovery.

I’m now ready to get back to work and was wondering if you could share a new problem statement or suggest a model where I can start contributing. I’m eager to engage with something fresh and meaningful.

Also, I will share the link to the adder I had previously worked on in the description below for your reference.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Shubhro
